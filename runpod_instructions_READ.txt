These scripts are prepared for RunPod but they would work on any Linux system. It can be local or Cloud. Just change the paths accurately.

If you register RunPod with my link I appreicate : https://runpod.io?ref=1aka98lq

Login your pod you can use this link : https://runpod.io?ref=1aka98lq

If you don't know how to setup a Pod here written tutorial :

Select your GPU. I think best price / performance is RTX 3090

Select runpod template runpod/stable-diffusion:web-ui-10.2.1
You can use either community cloud, private or network stroage

Customize deployment
Make volume disk 150 gb - or any size you want according to your needs

Wait until you can click Connect and Connect to Jupyter Lab [Port 8888]

Enter inside stable-diffusion-webui folder
Upload relauncher.py and overwrite file. Then restart your pod. This is mandatory only 1 time.
This is important to kill auto started Automatic1111 Web UI instance and start our own from terminal.

Then upload everything into workspace folder.

If you want to install everything and download everything run below command

export HF_HOME="/workspace"
cd /workspace
chmod +x install_all.sh
./install_all.sh

If you execute above code and install all, you don't need any of below. They will all be installed.

Now we have different installers

The first one is install_latest_auto_1111.sh

This file will update automatic1111 to the latest version and its controlnet extension to latest version including insightface library - but will not download controlnet models yet

Then it will automatically start latest version of automatic1111 SD web ui with latest version ControlNet

This file will download 275 Amazing Fooocus styles csv that you can use in Automatic1111 SD Web UI

To run it copy paste below command

export HF_HOME="/workspace"
cd /workspace
chmod +x install_latest_auto_1111.sh
./install_latest_auto_1111.sh
cd /workspace/stable-diffusion-webui
python relauncher.py

After that if you want to install TensorRT execute below code. this will also updated controlnet (including insightface library) and tensorRT to latest version and restart automatic1111 web UI

TensorRT not yet supporting ControlNet but they have a development branch : https://github.com/NVIDIA/Stable-Diffusion-WebUI-TensorRT/tree/controlnet_v2 

This file will download 275 Amazing Fooocus styles csv that you can use in Automatic1111 SD Web UI

This is almost ready i am waiting it to be merged into main to update

The tutorial of TensorRT here : https://youtu.be/kvxX6NrPtEk

And another tutorial of TensorRT : https://youtu.be/eKnMVXVjVoU

export HF_HOME="/workspace"
cd /workspace
chmod +x install_tensorRT.sh
./install_tensorRT.sh
cd /workspace/stable-diffusion-webui
python relauncher.py

Let's say you want to download all controlnet models
Then you need to run below command
This command will download huge amount of models 40GB+

control_net_downloader.py file will download all of the available ControlNet models that I know total number of 52.
The downloader will download into the accurate folder with accurate naming.

python download_ip_adapter_and_instantid.py will download ip-adapter-faceid-plusv2_sd15_lora, ip-adapter-faceid-plusv2_sdxl_lora, ip-adapter_instant_id_sdxl and control_instant_id_sdxl into the accurate folders with accurate naming. Accurate naming is crucial.

I will hopefully update scripts if there be new model releases.

export HF_HOME="/workspace"
cd /workspace
python control_net_downloader.py
python download_ip_adapter_and_instantid.py

Using ip-adapter-faceid and instant_id_sdxl are not straight forward. 

Please read the following threads:

Ip Adapter Face ID of ControlNet : https://github.com/Mikubill/sd-webui-controlnet/discussions/2442
InstantID of ControlNet : https://github.com/Mikubill/sd-webui-controlnet/discussions/2589

However I find that, these both models are working very poor compared to my direct implementation of their pipelines into a single Gradio app with 1 click installer.

You can download them from

1 Click Automatic Installer & A Very Advanced GUI For InstantId For Windows, RunPod, Linux & Kaggle Notebook:
https://www.patreon.com/posts/1-click-very-gui-97769887

IP-Adapter-FaceID-PlusV2 - 0 Shot Face Transfer - Auto Installer & Gradio App
https://www.patreon.com/posts/ip-adapter-0-app-95759342

Both of my apps has instructions and installers for both Windows, RunPod (Linux) & Kaggle notebooks

after this operation i suggest you to restart your web ui with following command
fuser -k 3000/tcp
cd /workspace/stable-diffusion-webui
python relauncher.py

You can also run download_models.py file

This file will download the following models

Realistic_Vision_V6 (SD 1.5 based model - one of the very best)
sdxl-vae-fp16-fix - fixed SDXL VAE in FP16 so you can run in Automatic1111 in FP16
playground-v2-1024px - which is a very high aesthetic score having SDXL model
Hyper_Realism_V3 - which is the best SD 1.5 realism model that I find

To download any custom model you want, execute below command
cd /workspace/stable-diffusion-webui/models/Stable-diffusion

Then use below format
wget "download_link_of_model"
